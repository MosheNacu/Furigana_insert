To help make reading in Nihongo easier

The Japanese make use of three different character sets for their writing.
The Hiragana character set is used for native Japanese words.
The Katakana chracter set is used for foreign words.
The Kanji characters are the adopted Chinese characters.
Furigana is a form of reading aid consisting of smaller kana usually found on top or next to the Kanji characters.

The program can take an image of Japanese text written horizontally, and convert it into machine-encoded chracters using Optical Character Recognition(OCR).
It also analizes the text and separates the Kanji from the rest of the characters and adds the furigana next to it in parenthesis.
